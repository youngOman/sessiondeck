<h1 align="center">c9watch</h1>

<p align="center">Monitor and control all your Claude Code sessions — built for both humans and agents.</p>

**c9watch** (short for **c**laude cod**e** watch, like k8s for Kubernetes) gives you a real-time view of every Claude Code session running on your machine. A **desktop dashboard** for you, and a **JSON CLI** for your agents — both watching the same sessions at the same time.

You see which agent needs permission, which one is working, and which one is idle. Your agents can do the same — querying session status, searching past work, and coordinating with each other — all through the same tool.

## Demo

![Demo](docs/screenshots/demo.gif)

## Works with everything. Tied to nothing.

Unlike other Claude Code management tools that require you to launch sessions from within their app, **c9watch doesn't care where you start your sessions**. It discovers them automatically by scanning running processes at the OS level.

Start Claude Code from any terminal or IDE you already use -- VS Code, Zed, iTerm2, Antigravity, you name it -- and c9watch picks them all up. No plugins to install. No workflows to change. No vendor lock-in.

Just open c9watch and see everything.

## Lightweight and fast.

Built with **Tauri**, **Rust**, and **Svelte** -- not Electron. The app binary is small, memory usage is minimal, and the UI stays snappy. Rust handles process scanning and file parsing at native speed. Svelte compiles away the framework overhead. You're already running multiple Claude Code agents eating up resources -- your monitoring tool shouldn't add to the pile.

## Install

### Desktop app (macOS)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minchenlee/c9watch/main/install.sh | bash
```

This installs the app to `/Applications` and symlinks the CLI to `~/.local/bin/c9watch`, so both the GUI and `c9watch list`, `c9watch view`, etc. work out of the box.

Or grab the latest `.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/minchenlee/c9watch/releases) page (you'll need to symlink the CLI manually: `ln -s /Applications/c9watch.app/Contents/MacOS/c9watch ~/.local/bin/c9watch`).

### CLI only (macOS & Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minchenlee/c9watch/main/install-cli.sh | bash
```

Installs to `~/.local/bin` by default. Use `| bash -s -- --global` to install to `/usr/local/bin` instead.

### Build from source

Prerequisites: [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+), and the [Tauri CLI](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/minchenlee/c9watch.git
cd c9watch
npm install
npm run tauri build       # Desktop app → src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/
```

To build just the CLI (no Node.js or Tauri CLI needed):

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features cli
# Binary → target/release/c9watch
```

## Screenshots

### Monitor -- see what needs your attention first

Sessions grouped by status. Permission requests surface to the top so you never leave an agent stuck waiting.

## CLI

The same `c9watch` binary doubles as a CLI for scriptable session management. All output is JSON, designed for piping into `jq` or consumption by other coding agents.

```bash
# List active sessions
c9watch list
c9watch list --project myapp --status Working --compact

# Aggregate status summary
c9watch status

# View a conversation (prefix matching works)
c9watch view abc123 --last 5 --pretty

# Browse and search history
c9watch history -n 20
c9watch search "fix the auth bug" --project myapp

# Identify the calling agent's own session
c9watch self

# Stop a session
c9watch stop 12345

# Watch for status changes (NDJSON stream)
c9watch watch --interval 2 --compact --changes-only

# View tasks/todos for a session
c9watch tasks abc123

# Cost breakdown, including per-session lookup
c9watch cost --daily
c9watch cost --session abc12345 --pretty
c9watch cost --session-prefix abc

# PM orchestration: spawn and manage child worker sessions
c9watch spawn --name my-worker --cwd ../my-worktree --append-system-prompt "..."
c9watch send <session-id> --message "do this task"
c9watch workers
c9watch inbox --pretty
```

Use `--pretty` on any command for human-readable JSON. The `watch` command streams newline-delimited JSON events (`started`, `status_changed`, `stopped`) for real-time monitoring.

c9watch ships with a [Claude Code skill](skills/c9watch-cli/SKILL.md) that teaches Claude how to use the CLI. Install it to let Claude Code monitor sibling sessions, search past work, and coordinate with other agents:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/c9watch/skills/c9watch-cli ~/.claude/skills/c9watch-cli
```

See [SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md) for more install options.

## Features

- **Debug console** -- Hidden diagnostic panel (`Cmd+Shift+D`) for troubleshooting session detection issues

## How it works

**Live monitoring** -- A background thread polls every 2 seconds, scanning for running `claude` processes using `sysinfo`. Each process is matched to its session file in `~/.claude/projects/` via path encoding and timestamp correlation. The last N entries of each session's JSONL file are parsed to determine status:

- **Working** -- Claude is generating a response or executing tools
- **Needs Attention** -- A tool requires user approval, or Claude is asking the user a question
- **Idle** -- Session is waiting for your next prompt

Status updates are pushed to the Svelte frontend via Tauri events. The UI reactively updates, sorting sessions by priority (permission requests surface first).

**Session history** -- Reads `~/.claude/history.jsonl` for the session index, then scans individual JSONL files across all project directories for deep content search. Results link back to the full conversation viewer with scroll-to-match highlighting.

**Cost tracking** -- Parses assistant message metadata from JSONL files to extract model usage and token counts. Costs are computed using per-model pricing tables and cached by file mtime to avoid re-scanning unchanged sessions.
